Understood concepts related to **Dual** numbers, **floating point** numbers, their **conversions** and **promotions** in Julia, performed listed **comparisons** between two MultiDuals and a MultiDual and a number, wrote the listed **functions**.
Faced difficulty with the **wrapper** function and **Jacobian** function.
