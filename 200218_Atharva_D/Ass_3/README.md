# Curve fitting for a Quadratic Polynomial using Zygote

## Polynomial used: &nbsp;y = x<sup>2</sup>+2x+1
<br>

## General Polynomial taken: f(x) = a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>2</sup>+b<sub>1</sub>x+c<sub>1</sub>

<br>

## Assumed a, b and c&nbsp;: 
### a = 0.5, b = 1.5 and c = 0.5

<br>

## Using Loss Function, we try to minimise the loss, after which the obtained values for a, b and c were:

### a = 0.999926501000306
### b = 2.0053678955175975
### c = 0.9090524015188057
### Clearly, the obtained values are pretty close to the assumed/expected values, and hence the curve fitting has been successfully accomplished
